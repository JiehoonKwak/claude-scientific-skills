# Citation Styles Guide

## Overview

Citation styles provide standardized formats for acknowledging sources in scientific writing. Different disciplines prefer different styles, and journals typically specify which style to use. The five most common citation styles in science are AMA, Vancouver, APA, Chicago, and IEEE.

## Choosing the Right Style

| Style | Primary Disciplines | In-Text Format |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| AMA | Medicine, health sciences | Superscript numbers¹ |
| Vancouver | Biomedical sciences | Numbers in brackets [1] |
| APA | Psychology, social sciences, education | Author-date (Smith, 2023) |
| Chicago | Humanities, history, some sciences | Notes-bibliography or author-date |
| IEEE | Engineering, computer science | Numbers in brackets [1] |
| ACS | Chemistry | Superscript numbers¹ or (1) |
| NLM | Life sciences, PubMed | Numbers in brackets [1] |

**Default recommendation**: When in doubt, check the journal's author guidelines. Most biomedical journals use Vancouver or AMA style.

## AMA Style (American Medical Association)

### Overview
- Used primarily in medical research
- Based on the *AMA Manual of Style* (11th edition, 2020)
- Numbered citations appearing as superscripts
- References listed numerically in order of appearance

### In-Text Citations

**Basic format**: Superscript numerals outside periods and commas, inside semicolons and colons.

**Examples:**
```
Several studies have demonstrated this effect.¹

The results were inconclusive,² although Smith et al³ reported otherwise.

These findings³⁻⁵ suggest a correlation.

One meta-analysis⁶ found significant heterogeneity; however, the pooled effect was significant.⁷
```

**Multiple citations**: Use commas or hyphens for ranges
```
Multiple studies¹,³,⁵⁻⁷ have confirmed this.
```

**Same source cited multiple times**: Use the same number throughout

### Reference List Format

**Journal Articles:**
```
1. Author AA, Author BB, Author CC. Title of article. Journal Name. Year;Volume(Issue):Page range. doi:xx.xxxx
```

**Example:**
```
1. Smith JD, Johnson AB, Williams CD. Effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders. JAMA Psychiatry. 2023;80(5):456-464. doi:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2023.0123
```

**Books:**
```
2. Author AA. Book Title. Edition. Publisher; Year.
```

**Book Chapters:**
```
3. Chapter Author AA. Chapter title. In: Editor AA, Editor BB, eds. Book Title. Edition. Publisher; Year:Page range.
```

**Online Resources:**
```
4. Organization Name. Page title. Website name. Published date. Updated date. Accessed date. URL
```

### Special Cases

**More than 6 authors**: List first 3, then "et al"
```
Smith JD, Jones AB, Williams CD, et al.
```

**No author**: Begin with title

**Advance online publication**:
```
Published online Month Day, Year. doi:xx.xxxx
```

- Described in *Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals*
- Also called "author-number style"
- Numbered citations in square brackets
- References listed numerically

### In-Text Citations

**Basic format**: Numbers in square brackets after the relevant text, before periods and commas.

**Examples:**
```
Several studies have shown this effect [1].

The results were inconclusive [2], although Smith et al [3] reported otherwise.

These findings [3-5] suggest a correlation.

Multiple studies [1,3,5-7] have confirmed this.
```

### Reference List Format

**Journal Articles:**
```
1. Author AA, Author BB, Author CC. Title of article. Journal Name. Year;Volume(Issue):Page range.

## General Citation Best Practices

### Across All Styles

**When to cite:**
- Direct quotations
- Paraphrased ideas from others
- Statistics, data, or figures from other sources
- Theories, models, or frameworks developed by others
- Information that is not common knowledge

**Citation density:**
- Introduction: Cite liberally to establish context
- Methods: Cite when referencing established protocols or instruments
- Results: Rarely cite (focus on your own findings)
- Discussion: Cite frequently when comparing to prior work

**Source quality:**
- Prefer peer-reviewed journal articles
- Cite original sources when possible (not secondary citations)
- Use recent sources (within 5-10 years for active fields)
- Ensure sources are reputable and relevant

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Inconsistent formatting
- Missing required elements (DOI, page numbers, etc.)
- Citing sources not actually read (citation chaining)
- Over-reliance on review articles instead of primary sources
- Including uncited references or missing cited references
- Incorrect author names or initials
- Wrong year of publication
- Truncated titles

### Managing Citations

**Reference Management Software:**
- **Zotero**: Free, open-source, browser integration
- **Mendeley**: Free, PDF annotation, social features
- **EndNote**: Commercial, powerful, institutional support
- **RefWorks**: Web-based, institutional subscriptions

**Software benefits:**
- Automatic formatting in multiple styles
- In-text citation insertion
- Reference list generation
- PDF organization
- Sharing capabilities

### Verifying Citations

**Before submission, check:**
1. Every in-text citation has a corresponding reference
2. Every reference is cited in text
3. Formatting is consistent throughout
4. Author names and initials are correct
5. Titles are accurate
6. Journal names match required abbreviations
7. Volume, issue, and page numbers are correct
8. DOIs are included (when required)
9. URLs are functional (for web sources)
10. Citations appear in correct order (numerical styles)

## DOI (Digital Object Identifier)

### What is a DOI?
A unique alphanumeric string identifying digital content permanently.

**Format:**
```
doi:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2023.0123
or
https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2023.0123
```

### When to include:
- Required by most journals for recent publications
- Preferred over URLs because DOIs don't change
- Look up DOIs at https://www.crossref.org/ if not provided

### Style-specific formatting:
- **AMA**: `doi:10.xxxx/xxxxx`
- **APA**: `https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx`
- **Vancouver**: Often omitted or added at journal's discretion
- **Chicago**: `https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx`

## Transitioning Between Styles

When converting between citation styles:

1. **Use reference management software** for automatic conversion
2. **Check these elements** that vary by style:
   - In-text citation format (numbered vs. author-date)
   - Author name format (initials vs. full names)
   - Title capitalization (sentence case vs. title case)
   - Journal name formatting (abbreviated vs. full)
   - Punctuation (periods, commas, semicolons)
   - Use of italics and bold
   - Order of elements
3. **Manually verify** after automatic conversion
4. **Check journal guidelines** for specific requirements
