# Scientific Integrations

## Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) & R&D Platforms
- **Benchling Integration** - Toolkit for integrating with Benchling's R&D platform, providing programmatic access to laboratory data management including registry entities (DNA sequences, proteins), inventory systems (samples, containers, locations), electronic lab notebooks (entries, protocols), workflows (tasks, automation), and data exports using Python SDK and REST API

## Cloud Platforms for Genomics & Biomedical Data
- **DNAnexus Integration** - Comprehensive toolkit for working with the DNAnexus cloud platform for genomics and biomedical data analysis. Covers building and deploying apps/applets (Python/Bash), managing data objects (files, records, databases), running analyses and workflows, using the dxpy Python SDK, and configuring app metadata and dependencies (dxapp.json setup, system packages, Docker, assets). Enables processing of FASTQ/BAM/VCF files, bioinformatics pipelines, job execution, workflow orchestration, and platform operations including project management and permissions

## Laboratory Automation
- **Opentrons Integration** - Toolkit for creating, editing, and debugging Opentrons Python Protocol API v2 protocols for laboratory automation using Flex and OT-2 robots. Enables automated liquid handling, pipetting workflows, hardware module control (thermocycler, temperature, magnetic, heater-shaker, absorbance plate reader), labware management, and complex protocol development for biological and chemical experiments

## Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN)
- **LabArchives Integration** - Toolkit for interacting with LabArchives Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) REST API. Provides programmatic access to notebooks (backup, retrieval, management), entries (creation, comments, attachments), user authentication, site reports and analytics, and third-party integrations (Protocols.io, GraphPad Prism, SnapGene, Geneious, Jupyter, REDCap). Includes Python scripts for configuration setup, notebook operations, and entry management. Supports multi-regional API endpoints (US, UK, Australia) and OAuth authentication

## Workflow Platforms & Cloud Execution
- **LatchBio Integration** - Integration with the Latch platform for building, deploying, and executing bioinformatics workflows. Provides comprehensive support for creating serverless bioinformatics pipelines using Python decorators, deploying Nextflow/Snakemake pipelines, managing cloud data (LatchFile, LatchDir) and structured Registry (Projects, Tables, Records), configuring computational resources (CPU, GPU, memory, storage), and using pre-built Latch Verified workflows (RNA-seq, AlphaFold, DESeq2, single-cell analysis, CRISPR editing). Enables automatic containerization, UI generation, workflow versioning, and execution on scalable cloud infrastructure with comprehensive data management

## Microscopy & Bio-image Data
- **OMERO Integration** - Toolkit for interacting with OMERO microscopy data management systems using Python. Provides comprehensive access to microscopy images stored in OMERO servers, including dataset and screening data retrieval, pixel data analysis, annotation and metadata management, regions of interest (ROIs) creation and analysis, batch processing, OMERO.scripts development, and OMERO.tables for structured data storage. Essential for researchers working with high-content screening data, multi-dimensional microscopy datasets, or collaborative image repositories

## Protocol Management & Sharing
- **Protocols.io Integration** - Integration with protocols.io API for managing scientific protocols. Enables programmatic access to protocol discovery (search by keywords, DOI, category), protocol lifecycle management (create, update, publish with DOI), step-by-step procedure documentation, collaborative development with workspaces and discussions, file management (upload data, images, documents), experiment tracking and documentation, and data export. Supports OAuth authentication, protocol PDF generation, materials management, threaded comments, workspace permissions, and institutional protocol repositories. Essential for protocol standardization, reproducibility, lab knowledge management, and scientific collaboration
